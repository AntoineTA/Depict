Depict is a mobile app designed to inspire creativity and spontaneity through daily photography challenges.

## Run the application locally

First, get the files, either from the submitted .zip or by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntoineTA/Depict.git
```

Then, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Expo Snack

The code for this application is also available as an [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@antoineta/depict)

Note that because the React Native Paper requires additional configuration to run on the web (see [here](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/react-native-web)), the web version is not available on Expo Snack.
